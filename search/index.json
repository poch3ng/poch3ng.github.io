[{"content":"Abstract This paper proposes a virtual production camera system, which allows photographers to connect the camera and the virtual environment quickly and capture the moving trajectory of the camera in reality through HTC VIVE and iPhone. It is synchronized with the virtual camera, allowing users to preview the synthesized result in real-time. We use homemade buttons and assist system programs to maintain the photographerâ€™s existing shooting process and ease the transition from traditional to virtual production.\nTracking Device Setup HTC VIVE iPhone Snapshots Demo Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
